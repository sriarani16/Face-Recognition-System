# Face Detection and Recognition System using OpenCV

## Overview

This project implements a real-time Face Detection and Face Recognition system using Python and OpenCV. The system captures facial images through a webcam, trains a recognition model using collected face datasets, and identifies known individuals in real time.

The project uses Haar Cascade Classifiers for face detection and the Fisher Face Recognizer algorithm for face recognition.

## Project Workflow

### Step 1: Face Detection

The system detects human faces in real time using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier.

* Captures video from webcam
* Detects faces in each frame
* Draws bounding boxes around detected faces
* Displays live detection results

---

### Step 2: Dataset Creation

The dataset collection module:

* Captures face images from webcam
* Converts images to grayscale
* Resizes images to a fixed size (130 × 100)
* Stores images in a dataset directory

Example:

```text
datasets/
└── Suren/
    ├── 1.png
    ├── 2.png
    ├── 3.png
    └── ...
```

---

### Step 3: Model Training

The training module:

* Reads face images from the dataset
* Assigns labels to each person
* Trains a Fisher Face Recognizer model
* Creates a facial recognition model for real-time predictions

---

### Step 4: Face Recognition

The recognition system:

* Detects faces from webcam feed
* Compares detected faces against trained datasets
* Displays recognized person's name
* Labels unrecognized faces as "Unknown"
* Saves images of unknown persons for further analysis
